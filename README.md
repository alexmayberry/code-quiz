# code-quiz
A [LIVE](https://alexmayberry.github.io/code-quiz/) multiple choice quiz game that keeps a timer and high score log.


# Roadmap for project (to be deleted)

## `HTML`
- Create basic html structure with question, answers, results, high score, and time elements.

## `CSS`
- Style those elements
-

## `JS`
- I'm unsure what I should make into a function, what I should make into an object, and what I should just list out.


## Order of Operations from Anthony
1. Make repo and files
2. Make first absolutley basic html elements
3. Make first jS variables and objects to get started.
